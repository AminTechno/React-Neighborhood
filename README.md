# My Neighborhood React Project
Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree , project 7
---
## Overview:
This is a single page application showing a map of some Malls in Newark, DE. 
The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map.
This App made as the final project of the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree following [Udacity Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1351/view) 


## How to Run the Application:

- make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, or get them [here](https://nodejs.org/it/download).
- Once node.js is installed, install the react package using this command: `npm install -g create-react-app`.
- install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

Now the environment is ready, go ahead and 
- Clone or install the project to your local machine.
- unzip the installed folder.
- open command prompt/terminal and change directory to the project folder, example: `cd c:/downloads/project-folder`.
- install all the project's dependencies using this command: `yarn install`..
- to start the app, run this command `yarn start`.
- This will start the app in your default browser at: localhost:3000.

## Important:

The project was created with create-react-app and I used the created service worker for it, so if you want to use the **Service Worker** create-react-app in your computer and put my files in it.
The **Service Worker** works in the **production build**.
